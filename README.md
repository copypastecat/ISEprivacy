KTH ISE "Privacy Group" -- Repo for Misc-things etc. 

## Paper Club

We have a tri-weekly paper session, where each meeting, someone chooses a paper to read and present. The other members should also read the paper before the meeting, so that we can have a discussion about the content in as much detail as possible. If you want to become part of the club, write to me with a paper suggestion under lgrosse + the usual KTH mail-domain.

Here is the schedule for 2025:
